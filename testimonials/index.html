                I can't say enough good things about the Waiuku Colony Cats Rescue. I adopted my own sweet cat through them and helped my parents adopt two of their own. Each experience was so smooth and positive. Ally and the whole team are incredibly kind, responsive, and clearly care deeply about every cat that comes through their doors. They do incredible work feeding and caring for local cat colonies, rescuing and rehoming countless kittens, and supporting foster carers and new kitten parents along the way. The rescue is run entirely on donations and love, and the wellbeing of the cats is always their top priority. So grateful for everything they do!

                We had been looking for a kitten to join our family for a while, but as we already have an energetic fox terrier the challenge of finding the right cat had proved too hard. After spotting a Facebook post with tabby kitten Duncan sitting calmly alongside a large dog, I began a conversation with the wonderful Waiuku Colony Cat Rescue. They listened to our background story and home environment and provided us with a very good personality brief of little Duncan. Of course we had to meet him and then there was no going back! His name is now Monty although we have kept Duncan as his middle name. We slowly introduced him to Sparky the foxy, who was obsessed with Monty from day one. That was back in February, fast forward to now and they are firm friends and enthusiastic wrestling partners. Throughout this whole process the Waiuku Cat Colony have kept in touch with helpful advice, even dropping off some probiotic gut powder when Monty had an upset tummy. We are so grateful for the help and support they have provided and we love having Monty as part of our crazy, happy family.

                I recently adopted two adorable kittens from WaiukuColonyCatsRescue. Their names are Floyd and Charlie. Floyd was my first little companion, but I soon realized he needed a playmate, so Charlie joined our family! Both are still playful kittens, and it's a joy watching them grow and bond together.<br><br>
                At first, I was a bit hesitant about adopting a kitten, but I couldn't be happier with my decision. A huge thank you to Ally and all the wonderful foster families for their care and for making the adoption process so easy and welcoming.

            <p>
                In February 2023 I went on holiday overseas and left my friends in charge of my 4 cats and dog. Just after I left the big storms hit and my friends moved into my house to make sure all was well with the animal family. In the middle of those storms my friends sent me a photo of four kittens sitting on my back path with the question “Do we feed these too?” On my return I discovered the four kittens and their mother had moved into my empty dog kennel. The kittens were becoming wild. I messaged Ally asking first to get help trapping them and then to rehome them. Poor Ally was swamped with kittens but she came to my rescue. One kitten stayed with me. She took three and having discovered Mum was a neighbours cat Ally arranged for them to have her spayed. It was a happy outcome for all concerned thanks to having a local person dedicated to giving Waiuku cats a chance
