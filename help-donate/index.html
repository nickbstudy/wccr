            <h3 class="center">Who we are and what we do</h3>
            <p>
                We rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome stray and abandoned cats and kittens.  Our work includes desexing, feeding, vet care, fostering, education, and community support. We also care for established cat colonies and respond to urgent welfare cases whenever resources allow. However as we are a small team of volunteers, we can't always help.<br>Please note if you have an urgent case of animal welfare, please contact the SPCA or take the animal to any veterinary clinic.    
            </p>

            <h3 class="center">Where are you located?</h3>
            <p>
                We're based in Waiuku, but because we're entirely run by volunteers, we don't have a central shelter or depot.  All of our cats and kittens are in foster homes across the Franklin Region, being raised in loving family homes until they're adopted.
            </p>

            <h3 class="center">How Are We Funded?</h3>
            <p>
                Waiuku Colony Cat Rescue doesn't receive any government funding, we're entirely volunteer-run.  Most of our funding comes from grassroots fundraising efforts like raffles, and sausage sizzles, along with the kind generosity of our supporters.  When unexpected vet bills pop up, from unpredictable situations like a badly injured cat or kitten it's the kindness of our supporters that helps us cover the costs and keep going.

            <h3 class="center">How can I help or volunteer?</h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways to help! We're always looking for foster homes, transport help, fundraising support, and volunteers to help feed our colony cats. Even if you can't foster, you might be able to help with admin, events, or odd jobs. Just visit our volunteer page or send us a message, we're always grateful for help!

            <h3 class="center">Can I visit the cats?</h3>
            <p>
                Unfortunately not, because our cats are in private foster homes, visits are by appointment only. If you're interested in adopting, we can arrange a time for you to meet the cat or kitten in their foster home.

                In some cases, yes, but it depends on our current capacity and the circumstances. We prioritise the most urgent and at-risk cats, so please message us with your situation and we'll do our best to help in whatever capacity we can at that time.
